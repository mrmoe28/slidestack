# 🔍 Automated Deployment Monitoring

## Status: ✅ ACTIVE

**Last Check:** All systems operational - Build passing with performance optimizations

---

## 📊 Current Build Status

### Local Build
- ✅ **ESLint**: No warnings or errors
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Type checking passed
- ✅ **Build**: Successful compilation
- ✅ **Production**: Ready to deploy
- ✅ **Performance**: Lazy loading implemented

### Recent Fixes
1. ✅ Fixed infinite re-render loops in MediaUploader (removed toast from deps)
2. ✅ Implemented lazy loading for all heavy editor components
3. ✅ Added React.lazy() + Suspense for code splitting
4. ✅ Converted MediaUploader to lazy loading pattern (onMouseEnter/onFocus triggers)
5. ✅ Removed unused useEffect import (ESLint fix)
6. ✅ Performance optimization complete - faster page loads

### Latest Commit
- **Hash**: eacbd41
- **Type**: Performance optimization
- **Changes**: Lazy loading for MediaUploader, Timeline, PreviewControls, TextEditorPanel, ProjectEditorNew

## 🤖 Automated Monitoring System

### Auto-Fix Loop
Monitors build health and reports errors in real-time.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run the monitoring loop
pnpm monitor

# Or manually
node scripts/auto-fix-loop.mjs
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Continuous ESLint checking
- ✅ Build error detection
- ✅ TypeScript type validation
- ✅ Automatic error extraction and reporting
- ✅ 5-second polling interval
- ✅ Up to 10 iterations (50 seconds total)

### Check All
Comprehensive validation before deployment.

```bash
pnpm check-all
```

Runs:
1. ESLint
2. TypeScript type checking
3. Production build

---

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

### Automatic Fix Cycle
1. **Detect** - Monitor detects build errors
2. **Report** - Errors are extracted and displayed
3. **Fix** - Developer (or AI) fixes the issues
4. **Verify** - Auto-loop re-checks build
5. **Deploy** - Push to GitHub triggers Vercel deployment

### Manual Deployment Check
```bash
# Check Vercel deployment status
vercel ls

# View deployment logs
vercel logs [deployment-url]

# Inspect specific deployment
vercel inspect [deployment-url]
```

## 📁 Monitoring Scripts

### `/scripts/auto-fix-loop.mjs`
Continuous monitoring with automatic error detection.

**What it does:**
- Runs ESLint and build checks
- Extracts TypeScript errors
- Displays file paths and line numbers
- Waits 5 seconds between checks
- Stops when all errors are fixed

### `/scripts/monitor-vercel.mjs`
Vercel deployment status monitoring.

**What it does:**
- Polls Vercel API for deployment status
- Shows build progress (QUEUED → BUILDING → READY)
- Extracts deployment errors from logs
- Reports deployment URL when successful

---

## 🔧 Error Resolution Process

### Step 1: Detection
```bash
pnpm monitor
```

### Step 2: Analysis
The monitor will show:
- Error type (ESLint, TypeScript, Build)
- File path and line number
- Specific error message

### Step 3: Fix
1. Open the affected file
2. Navigate to the line number
3. Apply the fix based on error message

### Step 4: Verification
- Monitor automatically re-checks
- Build passes → Ready to deploy
- Build fails → Shows new/remaining errors

### Step 5: Deployment
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: [description]"
git push
```

Vercel automatically deploys from GitHub.

## 📈 Metrics

### Current Session
- **Errors Fixed**: 3
- **Iterations**: 3
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Time to Resolution**: < 5 minutes

### Error Types Resolved
1. TypeScript type mismatch (position state)
2. Type narrowing for union types
3. Build compilation errors

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Active Monitoring
The system is now configured to:
1. ✅ Automatically detect build errors
2. ✅ Report errors with file locations
3. ✅ Re-check after fixes
4. ✅ Continue until all errors resolved

### Manual Intervention Triggers
- Max iterations reached (10)
- Unknown error types
- Vercel deployment failures
- Runtime errors (not build-time)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Monitor Not Detecting Errors
1. Ensure you're in the correct directory
2. Run `pnpm install` to ensure dependencies
3. Check that TypeScript is configured (`tsconfig.json`)

### Vercel Deployment Issues
1. Check `.vercel/project.json` exists
2. Verify Vercel CLI is authenticated: `vercel whoami`
3. Check GitHub → Vercel integration is active

### Infinite Error Loop
1. Stop the monitor (Ctrl+C)
2. Manually run: `pnpm lint && pnpm build`
3. Review error messages carefully
4. Check for circular dependencies or missing imports

## 📝 Notes

- All scripts are in `/apps/web/scripts/`
- Monitoring runs in background-compatible mode
- Errors are logged with timestamps
- System exits with code 0 on success, 1 on failure
